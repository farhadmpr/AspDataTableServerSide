# AspDataTableServerSide

JQuery Datatables.net in ASP.NET Core â€“ Server-Side Processing.

JQuery Datatables is one of the most popular jQuery plugins that help create HTML tables and add a whole lot of interactive events to it. 

The Core Features that come along with JQuery Datatables are searching, sorting, pagination, JSON formatted source data, blazing fast load times, server side processing, client side processing and more. 

That said, it a highly flexible and powerful plugin.

I got help from <a href="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/blog/jquery-datatable-in-aspnet-core/" target="_blank">this</a> article and added the delete feature.
